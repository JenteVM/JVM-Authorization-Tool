# JVM Authorization Tool

This project is to serve as a basic authorization tool
## Quick rundown

This project is made by JenteVM, it serves as a simple multi application authorization tool in which every application can have a different (or shared) database and store or authorize their users, it has built in database authorization so people can be stopped from using the authorization API.

## Why you should or shouldn't use it

You should use this application if you are looking for something small scale that gives the smallest possible security layer because it only has basic security features so it is not recommended to anyone but people who create hobby projects which would benefit from having a central authorization point.
