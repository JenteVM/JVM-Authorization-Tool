Planned additions:

    Done and Tested 1. Create auth_token upon authentication (user_resource.py and user_service.py)
        - can be stored in cookies
        Done and Tested 1.1 add timestamps
            - creation date for showcase
            - timestamp to check if a person is within the authorized window
        Done and Tested (reauth is client sided) 1.2 have the user reauthorize if outside of the time frame and extend the time frame if checked for within the timeframe
            - makes it nicer for the user

    Done and Tested 2 make origins be able to be added via using an randomly generated auth token upon addition in the db registry
            - security feature so the db doesnt have to start with allowed origins but can gain them via the auth token
        Done and Tested 2.1 make auth token a 1 time use and than reset 
            - security reasons
        Done and Tested 2.2 make auth token be generatable
            - for adding new origins

    Done and Tested 3. add roles to the user database (user_model.py)
        - things like admin/user for more versatility in authorizition use

    Delayed 4. add a rate limiter
        - so the server can handle all requests and doesnt time out users unfairly

    Done and Tested 5. Only send neccisary info, think of only sending data to authorized users (user_resource.py)

    Delayed 6. allow all crud operations (registry and user, the resources dont have them yet)
